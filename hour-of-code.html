            Team 71 carried out an Hour of code on the November 5th at Secondary School No. 27 in Baku as a way to
            motivate young learners to learn how to code. In cooperation with the school's administration, we carried
            out a captivating session with 20 students of sixth and seventh grades.
        </p>
        <p id="text-2" class="toggle-text">
            We made sure that students from schools who do not often hold such activities were well reached allowing our
            outreach to be effective. Posters were put up for students who might be interested in the program and we
            made a special mention stating that there would be completion certificates to encourage participation. While
            getting started, there was an introduction that covered the basic principles of code which was presented on
            a screen and guidance was provided to the audience. Our team made it its priority so that every school
            member had a workable even degree comprehension of language and coding. Very few minor technical hiccups
            were solved as a result of collaboration and creativity.

            Students participated actively. They were inquisitive and assisted their colleagues. We were able to keep
            our eyes on the targets thanks to inspiring some distraction and promoting co-working.
        </p>

            Certificates were awarded when the session was complete in order to recognize participants. What’s more
            important, the kids have been introduced to coding, and students’ willingness to engage in additional
            education in technology was increased. Both students and our team had a fruitful experience, as it
            demonstrated the importance of collaboration and the capabilities of young people.
